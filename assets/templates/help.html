        using our kanban project management tool. Here,

    <h2 class="ml-mr-16px helpHTML-h2">What is Join</h2>
    <div class="text-container ml-mr-16px">
        <a class="a-help" href="/index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool
        designed and built by a group of dedicated students
        as part of their web development bootcamp at the
        Developer Akademie.
        <br><br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a
        highly effective method to visualize work, limit
        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
        <a class="a-help" href="/index.html">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban to help
        users manage their tasks and projects in an
        intuitive, visual interface.
        <br><br>
        It is important to note that Join is designed as an
        educational exercise and is not intended for
        extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure
        the best possible user experience, we cannot
        guarantee consistent availability, reliability,

    <div class="text-container ml-mr-16px mb-80px">
        <p class="mb-16px">
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a class="a-help" href="/index.html">Join</a>:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="help-list">
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                When you log in to <a class="a-help" href="/index.html">Join</a>, you'll find a default
                board. This board represents your project
                and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In
                Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".
            </li>
            <li class="help-list">
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                In <a class="a-help" href="/index.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate
                on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                section, click on "New contact", and fill in
                the required information. Once added, these
                contacts can be assigned tasks and they
                can interact with the tasks on the board.
            </li>
            <li class="help-list">
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you
                can start adding cards. Cards represent
                individual tasks. Click the "+" button under
                the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill
                in the task details in the card, like task
                name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
            </li>
            <li class="help-list">
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                As the task moves from one stage to
                another, you can reflect that on the board
                by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.
            </li>
            <li class="help-list">
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                Once a task is completed, you can either
                move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution
                when deleting cards, as this action is
                irreversible.

                Remember that using <a class="a-help" href="/index.html">Join</a> effectively
                requires consistent updates from you and
                your team to ensure the board reflects the
                current state of your project.
